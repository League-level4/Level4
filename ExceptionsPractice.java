	//1. create a main method to test the other methods
	
	//2. create a method that takes a string and checks if it matches a password of your choice. 
	//     throw a SecurityException if the string does not match the password
	
	//3. create a method that takes in two ints and a String and returns an int. The string will be 
	//    either "add" "multiply" or "subtract." Return the proper result with the two ints. 
	//    throw an UnsupportedOperationException if the string does not match a proper operation
	
	//4. create a method that takes an ArrayList of strings and an int. The method will then print
	//     all the objects from the list starting from the int. Throw an IndexOutOfBoundsException of
	//     the list does not contain that element
	
	//5. create a method that takes 2 ints and an ArrayList. This method will print the range of elements
	//    provided by the two ints. Throw an NumberFormatException if the numbers are not in ascending order.
	
	//6. Create a class called Vector2D that has two member floats called x and y.
	//     Create a method called normalize that takes in a Vector2D and returns a Vector2D. 
	//     The method should return the normal of the vector. Throw a DivideByZeroException if the
	//     x and y of the passed in vector are both 0.
